# House Prices ML

This is a machine learning competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) that is for predicting house prices given a real-world dataset. An overview and the original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/)


## Exploratory Data Analysis

An initial analysis of the data was done in [notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/bpattengale/house_prices/blob/main/notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb) to understand:

- Target varaible distribution and skewness
- Missing values
- Correlations of variables with the target 'SalePrice'
- Identify outliers
- Boxplots of categorical variables to compare the variation in 'SalePrice'
